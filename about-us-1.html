        <h2 class="weather-balloon">About Us</h2>
          <p>The University of Texas at Austin EcoCAR team has joined the Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition (AVTC) for the first time since its inception in 2008. The UT team brings together a diverse group of innovative and talented individuals to develop and optimize the 2023 Cadillac LYRIQ, the first all-electric Cadillac SUV.</p>
  
          <h2 class="weather-balloon">Our Mission</h2>
          <p>Our mission is to use cutting-edge technologies to create impactful solutions for novel mobility systems, and to foster a welcoming environment for our students to learn to work effectively in a multidisciplinary and diverse team.  We expect students in the group to develop personal and career skills and contribute to a better future for our society.

            Our vision is to build a strong bridge between UT Austin, government regulatory organizations, the automotive industry, our sponsors, and society. We endeavor to ensure that our students receive a high-quality and experiential education that will make them skilled drivers in the development of green transportation technologies.</p>
       
            <h2 class="weather-balloon">Our Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>- Quantitatively evaluate what sensors to include on the vehicle and achieve a realistic Vehicle Technical Proposal. Additionally, we will also begin algorithmic development on the sensor fusion algorithms with the goal of having a working object detection prototype in simulation by the end of the first year.</li>
                <li>- Introduce DEI initiatives that inform and impact the team in which they can be ambassadors for more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplaces.</li>
                <li>- Become a notable student organization on campus which brings together the brightest minds in various fields not limited to just engineering, entrepreneurship, or communications. The team aims to become a think-tank for innovative solutions to engineering and inclusivity in the automotive industry.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2 class="weather-balloon">What is the Advanced Vehicle Technology Competitions?</h2>
                <p>Established in 1988 by the U.S. Department of Energy and Argonne National Laboratory in partnership with the automotive industry, Advanced Vehicle Technology Competitions (AVTCs) are North America’s premier collegiate automotive engineering competitions and DOE’s flagship workforce development program for future automotive engineers. AVTCs engage students from middle school through higher education, creating a pipeline that both encourages students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and has seeded more than 30,000 graduates into industry, helping to build the diverse workforce needed for the U.S. to be competitive in the global marketplace.</p>

                <h2 class="weather-balloon">What is the EcoCar EV Challenge?</h2>
                <p>The EcoCAR EV Challenge is a four-year collegiate automotive engineering competition, providing an unparalleled, hands-on educational experience that transforms the traditional classroom environment into a hub of automotive innovation. The EcoCAR EV Challenge builds upon a proud 35+ year history of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Vehicle Technology Competitions (AVTCs). The EV Challenge charges 15 North American universities to engineer a next generation battery electric vehicle (BEV) that utilizes automation and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity to implement energy efficient and customer-pleasing features, while meeting the decarbonization need of the automotive industry.

                  <h2 class="weather-balloon">Competition Vehicle:</h2>
                  <p>General Motors will provide each team with a 2023 Cadillac LYRIQ where teams will demonstrate the potential of advanced propulsion systems, connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies, and other innovative technologies to analyze energy efficiency.

                    EcoCAR teams will utilize a combination of on-board sensors and bidirectional vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity to implement energy efficient and customer-pleasing automated control features. Teams also will refine advanced powertrain along with charging and thermal systems to use grid electricity intelligently.</p>
